## Setup Instructions

To run the program:

1. Download the .zip file and extract all contents.
2. With Python 3.8.5 installed, run main.py.

To run the program output the extra credit trace:

1. Uncomment line 353 in main.py.
2. With Python 3.8.5 installed, run main.py.

## Notes to Grader

One of our test machines had difficulty producing the full printed output. While the backend functionality performs as expected, it is possible that some Python configurations will have difficulty replicating our trace.

Additionally, the extra credit output has been commented out within our code. We placed our two traces within PDFs, rather than text files, for uniformity of filetype and ease of display.
